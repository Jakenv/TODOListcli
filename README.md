# TODO Console app
It's a simple app I made while learning C#

Requires **dotNet 8.0 runtime**

### Known bugs
- If you fill the list and then remove first entry and try to add new one, program will put new entry on the last spot overriting it. This is caused becasue of the method that is used to evaulate where to put new entry. I should add somekind of index checker or sorting method instead of the current loop
